# US_patent_phase_to_phase_matching

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) offers one of the largest repositories of scientific, technical, and commercial information in the world through its Open Data Portal. Patents are a form of intellectual property granted in exchange for the public disclosure of new and useful inventions. Because patents undergo an intensive vetting process prior to grant, and because the history of U.S. innovation spans over two centuries and 11 million patents.

This is my first approach solving a NLP task using Transformers on US_patent_phase_to_phase_matching competition on Kaggle. The model is trained on a novel semantic similarity dataset to extract relevant information by matching key phrases in patent documents. Determining the semantic similarity between phrases is critically important during the patent search and examination process to determine if an invention has been described before.
